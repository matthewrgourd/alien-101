## Section-by-Section Rewrite

### 1. About Section - Opening

**BEFORE:**
> "Alien101, whose real name is Lola Marquez, is a hedonist curious about new technology and passionate about electronic music. What she enjoys most is conveying her emotional response to music through visual artistry."

**AFTER:**
> "Look, I'm Lola Marquez—but you can call me Alien101. I make visuals for electronic music, and yes, I believe in aliens. If that's a problem for you, the door's that way."

**Changes:**
- Direct address ("Look, I'm...")
- Immediate personality injection
- Challenge to the reader ("If that's a problem...")
- Sets expectation for authenticity

---

### 2. About Section - Mannequins

**BEFORE:**
> "I share my flat with two mannequins…and a husband! They are my models and allow me to do anything with them without complaining."

**AFTER:**
> "Here's the thing: I share my flat with two mannequins and a husband. The mannequins are better models because they don't complain when I dress them up or dismember them for art. My work is surreal because reality is overrated, and I'd rather spend my time creating something that looks like it crawled out of a David Lynch fever dream crossed with a Stanley Kubrick film set."

**Changes:**
- Conversational opener ("Here's the thing:")
- Explicit comparison with humor
- Opinionated take ("reality is overrated")
- Vivid, memorable imagery
- Longer, more engaging prose

---

### 3. About Section - Influences

**BEFORE:**
> "Alien101 defines herself as a 'digital pop artist'. Her inventions are inspired by film-makers, painters, and photographers, including David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Dorothea Tanning and Tim Walker."

**AFTER:**
> "I call myself a digital pop artist, which is a fancy way of saying I take my emotional response to music and turn it into something you can watch while you're dancing. My influences include the usual suspects—Lynch, Kubrick, Dorothea Tanning, Tim Walker—but honestly, the best inspiration comes from my own weird brain and a belief that the universe is stranger than we're willing to admit."

**Changes:**
- Self-aware ("which is a fancy way of saying...")
- Plain-language explanation
- Dismissive of pretension ("the usual suspects")
- Personal ownership ("my own weird brain")
- Philosophical statement grounded in voice

---

### 4. About Section - Performance Style

**BEFORE:**
> "Alien101 uses advanced VDMX software for VJing and MadMapper for video mapping during her live performances. Where possible, she prefers to be positioned standing on stage alongside the musician with whom she's performing, rather than sitting in the sidelines."

**AFTER:**
> "When I perform live, I use VDMX for VJing and MadMapper for video mapping. Technical stuff aside, here's what matters: I don't hide in some dark corner operating a laptop. I stand on stage next to the musician because that's where the energy is. If you're going to create visuals for electronic music, you should be part of the show, not relegated to the sidelines like some kind of tech support."

**Changes:**
- Dismisses technical jargon ("Technical stuff aside")
- Strong opinion ("here's what matters")
- Vivid contrast ("dark corner" vs. "on stage")
- Clear philosophy with edge ("like some kind of tech support")
- Prescriptive statement about how it should be done

---

### 5. Portfolio Section - Intro

**BEFORE:**
> "Alien101 regularly attends and performs at AV events around London. She has provided live visuals for many electronica performances, including featured shows at StowLab, Plugged, CRUX, Feedback, Imerse Presents, 5th Dimension and Ravenswood for Eat or Heat Festival. She is currently performing live with the Australian electronic musician, Sol Flare (aka Dominic Wood), who combines 80's synths, dance floor beats and soulful elements."

**AFTER:**
> "I've been doing this across London for a while now—StowLab, Plugged, CRUX, Feedback, Imerse Presents, 5th Dimension and Ravenswood for Eat or Heat Festival. Currently, I'm collaborating with Sol Flare (Dominic Wood, an Australian electronic musician who knows his way around 80's synths and dance floor beats). We make weird, soulful stuff together."

**Changes:**
- Casual time reference ("for a while now")
- List format instead of formal introduction
- More natural description of collaborator
- Ending with attitude ("weird, soulful stuff")

---

### 6. Videos Section - The Master

**BEFORE:**
> "A music video Alien101 made for The Master, a DJ and music producer. Live-streamed at a Plugged IN event in October 2020."

**AFTER:**
> "This one's for The Master, a DJ and music producer. We live-streamed it at a Plugged IN event back in October 2020, because apparently performing during a pandemic required some creativity."

**Changes:**
- Direct reference ("This one's")
- Contextual humor ("apparently... required some creativity")
- Acknowledges pandemic reality with dry wit

---

### 7. Videos Section - Feedback Event

**BEFORE:**
> "Footage from an event in February 2020: Feedback Presents My Bloody Valentine at the Paxton Centre."

**AFTER:**
> "February 2020—back when we could actually gather in rooms together. This was Feedback Presents My Bloody Valentine at the Paxton Centre. Good times."

**Changes:**
- Nostalgia with context ("back when we could...")
- Personal reflection ("Good times")
- Em dash for emphasis

---

### 8. Videos Section - Chattels

**BEFORE:**
> "A music video that Alien101 produced for And/Or's officially released track, Chattels. She played it and other material during the launch of the band's Satellites EP at New River Studios."

**AFTER:**
> "And this is for And/Or's track Chattels. Played it at the launch of their Satellites EP at New River Studios, along with some other material that made people either dance or stare in confused fascination. Both reactions are fine by me."

**Changes:**
- Casual connector ("And this is...")
- Humor about audience reaction
- Opinionated acceptance ("Both reactions are fine by me")
- Self-aware about polarizing work

---

### 9. Stills Section - Description

**BEFORE:**
> "A flavour of the type of content Alien101 uses at gigs. One of her favourite things is to include messages in her visuals which the audience can respond to during the music."

**AFTER:**
> "Here's a sample of what I throw up on screens during gigs. One of my favorite tricks is embedding messages in the visuals—stuff the audience can actually interact with or respond to while they're dancing. It turns the whole thing into a conversation instead of just passive consumption."

**Changes:**
- Casual language ("throw up on screens")
- Playful framing ("favorite tricks")
- Explanation of intent ("turns... into a conversation")
- Positioning against passive consumption

---

### 10. Contact Section

**BEFORE:**
> "Like what you see? Get in touch. With Alien101's help, you'll be able to transform your electronic music gig into a truly exceptional event. Drop her a line using the below form:"

**AFTER:**
> "If you want to work together on something—whether it's a one-off gig, a series of shows, or a music video that'll make people say 'what the hell did I just watch?'—drop me a line below. I'm always up for collaborating with musicians who aren't afraid to get weird."

**Changes:**
- Natural conditional ("If you want to...")
- Specific options instead of vague promises
- Humor and self-awareness (audience reaction)
- Clear values statement ("who aren't afraid to get weird")

---

### 11. Site Description (config.toml)

**AFTER:**

- Personality injection ("weird")
- Specificity ("for electronic music")
